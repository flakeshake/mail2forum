Mail2forum (m2f) is a PHP-based message centre. Messages can be imported into the database, processed following certain rules, and exported in a variety of formats. Initially the project will enable bi-directional communication between mailing lists and a phpBB forum - posts to the forum will be emailed to the list, and emails will be imported and posted to the forum.

With the version 2.0 redesign, m2f will become totally modular, allowing any number of input and export 'channels'. Messages can be imported from, and exported to, different formats such as phpBB, vBulletin, RSS, NNTP, email, etc, etc.

Also included in the software package will be message moderation, storage and editing functionality, spam detection, mailing list features, multiple DB support, and many more features.
